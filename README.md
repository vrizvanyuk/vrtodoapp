Hi There,

This is a small ToDo app with a GUI written in python/kivy which works with a todo_data.txt file. Functionality described below:

Main Window:
 
  Today's Date is at the top of the GUI
  
  List of all ToDo items

Input Fields:
 
  Enter a new todo - enter a string
  
  Enter a number of todo to complete - enter a corresponding number visible in the list to mark the todo as complete

Buttons:
  
  Clear Completed Items - will clear all the completed todos from the list
  
  Add ToDo - will add the string from the first input field to the list and assign it a number
 
  Complete Todo - Item will remain in the GUI and marked as completed(strikethrough)

Bonus:

Unit test CI/CD via test_vrtodoapp.py requirements.txt and main.yml in the workflow.

Regards,

VR
